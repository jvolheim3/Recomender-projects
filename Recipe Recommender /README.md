# Recipe Recommender System
## Overview
This project aims to build a recipe recommender system using collaborative filtering techniques. The system will recommend recipes to users based on their preferences and interactions with other recipes. The dataset used for this project is the "Food.com Recipes and Interactions" dataset from Kaggle, which contains recipe data and user interactions.
